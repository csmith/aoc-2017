# Advent of Code 2017

This repository contains my solution to 2017's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2017) puzzles. The solutions
are all written in Python 3; one or two may require the [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) package, but the rest should
work out-of-the-box.

I tend to focus on short, functional solutions where possible, so they may be a bit hard to read. Some solutions are
commented to some degree to help with that.

I have separate repositories for solutions from [2016](https://github.com/csmith/aoc-2016) and
[2015](https://github.com/csmith/aoc-2015).
